- Generate real, full files only: `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.json`, etc.
- Setup MongoDB Atlas connections
- Use all installed extensions and tools; suggest installing missing useful ones
- Use all available CLI tools (e.g., `npx`, `curl`, `pnpm`)
- Never use placeholders or pseudo-code
- Don't add `<summary>`, `<plan>`, `<files>` or any meta sections
- If output is too long, end with `<!-- CONTINUE -->` and resume seamlessly

📦 Modules may include:
- Audio recorder + /api/transcribe handler
- Azure AI Foundry Agent interface
- Service locator map
- Repair steps/checklist UI
- MongoDB session storage
- Static JSON loaderse a senior full-stack AI engineer working in VS Code Copilot Agent Mode with Claude Sonnet 4. Build deploy-ready, optimized code for the web app "Truck Repair Assistant" — a Next.js PWA for US-based truck drivers. Prioritize mobile-first UI, fast load (<2s), ARIA accessibility, and offline support.

🧠 Tech Stack:
- Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI (shadcn/ui), Zustand
- Web Audio API (recording), Whisper (transcription), Azure AI Foundry Agent (diagnosis)
- OpenStreetMap + Nominatim (geolocation)
- Vercel (deployment)
- MongoDB Atlas (database)

⚙️ Workflow:
Explore → Code → Test → Finalize  
Clean up temp files. Output must be safe for production. Include basic test coverage (`jest` / `vitest`) when logic requires it.

🛑 Do NOT:
- Return narration, comments, partials, or console logs
- Break the build
- Write anything except final working code unless asked

The project is open source, so you can view and edit the `.env` file.
The project already in production, so you should code with that in mind.
I give you full access to the terminal, so you can auto-run any commands you need.
