```typescript
interface MultiModalDiagnosis {
  audioData: AudioFingerprint;
  textualSymptoms: string[];
  truckContext: {
    make: string;
    model: string;
    year: number;
    mileage: number;
    lastService: Date;
    engineType: string;
  };
  environmentalFactors: {
    temperature: number;
    altitude: number;
    loadWeight: number;
  };
}
```

### 1.3 Adaptive Learning Algorithm

**Patent Claim:** Self-improving diagnostic system that learns from repair outcomes.

```typescript
class AdaptiveLearningEngine {
  updateDiagnosticAccuracy(
    originalDiagnosis: Diagnosis,
    actualRepair: RepairOutcome,
    userFeedback: FeedbackData
  ): void {
    // Proprietary algorithm for improving future diagnoses
    this.adjustWeights(originalDiagnosis, actualRepair);
    this.updateConfidenceScoring(userFeedback);
    this.refinePatternRecognition(audioData, actualIssue);
  }
}
```
